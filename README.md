Hi! My name is Jade and I'm a newbie to this GitHub world. 

I'm trained in data analysis and is studying towards obtaining my Associate of Science degree. I've had 2 years of working experience in total and I'm excited to grow beyond that number.

Feel free to contact me either at my GitHub or my LinkedIn.

Thanks for reading! <3
