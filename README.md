Hi! A little introduction about myself:

My name is Jade. I'm trained in data analysis and am studying to obtain my Associate of Science degree. I have two years of working experience and I am excited to grow beyond that number.

Feel free to connect with me either through GitHub or LinkedIn.

Thanks for reading! <3
